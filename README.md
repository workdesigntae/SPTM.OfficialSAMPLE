Hi, My name is Mon'Taveon Johnson, 23 years old currently a college student majored in Bachelor’s in Information Technology from Western Governors University (WGU), with hands-on skills in UX design, AR development, mobile app building, and community-focused tech solutions.

I created the SPTM AR Mobile App Demo as a passion project for my cousin’s clothing brand as i wanted his brand to expand beyond clothing. The idea was to explore how technology—specifically augmented reality—can be used not just for style, but for self-motivation and mental health awareness.

The demo allows users to scan a garment or tag and view 3D motivational messages like “Stop Procrastinating The Message” displayed on 3D overlay virtual clothing. I used Unity, Vuforia, ARKit/ARCore, and designed the UI/UX in Figma to ensure the app felt clean, encouraging, and purpose-driven.

This project brings together my technical training, creative design skills, and my personal mission to use technology as a tool for wellness, self-growth, and community empowerment.
